1.annotation 'Test':

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) 
@Target(ElementType.METHOD) 
public @interface Test { }

Here:
 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) meta-annotation indicates that Test annotations should be retained at runtime
 @Target(ElementType.METHOD) meta-annotation indicates that the Test annotation is legal only on method declarations
  
  e.g.
  
  public class Sample { @Test public static void m1() { }}  // Test should pass 
  
  
  2.
  
  use the Override annotation on every method declaration that you believe to override a supertype declaration
