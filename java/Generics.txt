Generics

Before generics, you had to cast
every object you read from a collection

The compiler inserts casts
for you automatically and tells you at compile time if you try to insert an object of
the wrong type


1.
Donâ€™t use raw types in new code

// Now a raw collection type - don't do this!
private final Collection stamps = ... ;  //will compiler but will give runtime error if you insert anything else in it.....

// Parameterized collection type - typesafe
private final Collection<Stamp> stamps = ... ;  //will only allow stamps...will fail at compile time which is better compared to run-time failing


2.
Use unbound wildcard type ('?') :
if you want generics but dont know type or care

You can put any element into collection with raw-type(e.g. Set)
You can only put null into wildcard type. e.g. Set<?>
