Serialization : convert object to byte-streams


1)Simple way is to make class implements serializable

2)Every serializable class has a UID

serialVersionUID which is static final long
If not declared explicitly, then its computed automatically

3)

Classes designed for inheritance should rarely implement Serializable, 

and interfaces should rarely extend it.
